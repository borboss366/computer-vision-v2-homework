## Homework 10

In this homework, you are going to use the code from ```TrafficSignsClassification``` notebook and create your own traffic sign classifier.

### Step 1
Use the data from ```data/subset_homework``` folder and visualize some examples. How many images are there for each class?

### Step 2
Run the training with one single neuron (as we did in the lecture). What accuracy can you achieve?
I achieved around 0.9 something. 

### Step 3
Make further modifications to improve the accuracy (e.g. add more neurons, more layers, etc.). What is the maximum accuracy you can achieve?
Theoretically 1.0. But it is not really good due to overfitting. I got om more advanced model around 0.96 (see the notebook)
